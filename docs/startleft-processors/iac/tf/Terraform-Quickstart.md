# Terraform Quickstart
## What is Terraform?

---
From the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank">official Terraform page</a>: 
> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, 
> change, and improve infrastructure.

From the StartLeft's perspective, a Terraform (TF) defines a format to write files that define sets of components 
with relationships among them which can be interpreted to create a threat model. 

## The `slp_tf` module

---
The `slp_tf` module is the StartLeft Processor responsible for converting TF files into OTM. Its operation is based 
on a mapping file that enables the users to define the translations between the source TF types and the expected 
output in the OTM file. 

Once you got familiarized with the basics explained in this page, you will need to know more about how to use and 
customize the behavior of the processor in order to configure your own conversions. For that, you should take a look 
to the [Terraform mapping page](Terraform-how-to-create-a-basic-mapping-file.md), where you will find all the information you need, from 
basic to advanced, to build your own CFT mapping files.

Apart from this, you may also find interesting the generic usage manuals for the [CLI](../../../usage/Command-Line-Interface.md) 
and [REST API](../../../usage/REST-API.md).

## A basic example

---

Let's suppose you have a TF file with a single 
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance" target="_blank">EC2 instance</a>
like this:


```terraform
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["123456789012"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```

And you want to translate it to OTM in order to import it into <a href="https://www.iriusrisk.com/" target="_blank">IriusRisk</a>,
whose equivalent type for an EC2 instance is an `ec2` component and the expected resultant project should be like this:

![img/ec2-iriusrisk.png](img/ec2-iriusrisk.png)

In that case, you will need a mapping file that contains, at least, a TrustZone and the mapping for the EC2 
component. Notice that the standard requires that all the components must have a parent, in this case, the _Public 
Cloud_ TrustZone is mapped as the default component's TrustZone. This mapping file could be as simple as this:
```yaml
trustzones:
  - id:   public-cloud-01
    name: Public Cloud
    type: b61d6911-338d-46a8-9f39-8dcd24abfe91
    $default: true

components:
  - type:        ec2
    $source:     {$type: "aws_instance"}

dataflows: []
```

The combination of this TF and mapping file will result in the OTM file below, that contains the mapped TrustZone 
and component along with all the necessary metadata defined by the standard and that is ready to be imported in a 
threat modeling tool like IriusRisk.

```json
{
  "otmVersion": "0.1.0",
  "project": {
    "name": "My EC2 project",
    "id": "my-ec2-project"
  },
  "representations": [
    {
      "name": "Terraform",
      "id": "Terraform",
      "type": "code"
    }
  ],
  "trustZones": [
    {
      "id": "public-cloud-01",
      "name": "Public Cloud",
      "type": "b61d6911-338d-46a8-9f39-8dcd24abfe91",
      "risk": {
        "trustRating": 10
      }
    }
  ],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "public-cloud-01.aws_instance-web",
      "name": "web",
      "type": "ec2",
      "parent": {
        "trustZone": "public-cloud-01"
      },
      "tags": [
        "aws_instance"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dataflows": []
}
```


### CLI
> **Note**: Before continue, make sure you have 
> [StartLeft properly installed](../../../Quickstart-Guide-for-Beginners.md) in your machine.

Save the files above in your file system with these names:

* `ec2-tf.json` for the Terraform file.
* `ec2-mapping.yaml` for the mapping file.

Now we are going to execute StartLeft for these files so that an `ec2.otm` file will be generated in our working 
directory with identical contents to the one above.
```shell
startleft parse \
	--iac-type TERRAFORM \
	--default-mapping-file ec2-mapping.yaml \
	--output-file ec2.otm \
	--project-id "my-ec2-project" \
	--project-name "My EC2 project" \
	ec2-tf.json
```

### cURL
You can get the same result if through the StartLeft's REST API. For that, in first place we need to set up the 
server with the command:
```shell
startleft server
```


Then, execute the following command to retrieve the OTM file with your EC2 component:
```shell
curl --location --request POST localhost:5000/api/v1/startleft/iac \
--header "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--form iac_type="TERRAFORM" \
--form iac_file=@"./ec2-tf.json" \
--form default_mapping_file=@"./ec2-mapping.yaml" \
--form id="my-ec2-project" \
--form name="My EC2 project"
```

## More examples

---
The infrastructure built with Terraform may be as complex as you want. This is the reason because 
StartLeft, through the mapping files, is intended to be configurable, so you can extend or modify its behavior and/or 
create your own mappings on demand.

To help you to walk through more complex situations with larger Terraform and mapping files, we have created a page 
with [explained TF examples](Terraform-Examples.md) which may be useful for you as a base for build your own mapping 
files.
